VR Play is a simple Android game that allows the user to test their device’s VR capabilities.
It uses Gyroscope sensors and Accelerometer sensors to test the position of the block.
It uses Google’s VR Libraries as a native operation to function.

<b>Note:</b> VR Play is a completely free and open-source app, developed as a hobby on free time by me.  I earn no money from this app, and I have zero interest in your personal data.
